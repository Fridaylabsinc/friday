"""
Task workflow state-machine hook for Agent Task documents.

Registered as ``doc_events["Agent Task"]["on_update"]`` in ``hooks.py``.

Responsibilities
----------------
1. Derive ``dispatchable`` from the current ``workflow_state``.
   dispatchable = True when workflow_state ∈ {Pending, Assigned}.
2. Record ``started_at`` when entering the Executing state.
3. Record ``completed_at`` when entering Completed or Cancelled.
4. Clear ``assigned_to_profile`` when entering Cancelled.
5. Emit ``agent_task.assigned`` on Frappe Redis pub/sub when
   transitioning Pending → Assigned so the task runner can pick it up
   outside the save transaction (avoids holding a DB lock while the
   worker runs).
6. Post a War Room update to the Raven FRIDAY_WAR_ROOM channel on
   every state transition (graceful degradation if Raven is not installed).
