    There should be exactly one row of this type, named "Agent Settings".
    It holds global defaults — primarily which LLM Provider to use when
    an Agent Profile doesn't specify one.

    The `autoincrement=False` in the JSON schema enforces that Frappe
    will not auto-create additional rows. The `after_migrate` hook in
    `frappe/hooks.py` creates the singleton on first site setup.
