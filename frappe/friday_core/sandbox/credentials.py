"""
Scoped credential management for sandbox execution.

Phase 1 (this module): generate_scoped_token() uses a SHA-256 of profile +
execution_id; the container uses it as a bearer token for the Frappe REST API.
Frappe does not yet verify the token — Phase 1.5 validates it.

Phase 1.5 wiring (per DOC 23 §2 and DOC 24 §7):
- Generate a Frappe API Key + Secret for the agent profile
  via frappe.generate_hash() (stored nowhere; short-lived per-execution)
- Set expiry to the container's wall-clock timeout
- Pass as FRIDAY_API_KEY env var
- Container uses it as Bearer token against /api/method endpoints
- Frappe validates expiry and scope server-side
  before executing any skill

Skill-level credentials (per DOC 23 Table §2):
- For skills requiring external credentials (e.g. SMTP for email),
  read Skill Credential DocType rows linked to the (Agent Profile, Skill)
  combination
- Inject resolved values as prefixed env vars (FRIDAY_CREDS_<name>)
- Never write credentials to disk; container env is the only channel
