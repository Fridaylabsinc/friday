Friday sandbox module.

Every skill execution runs inside an isolated Docker container with:
- Non-root user (UID 65532)
- Read-only rootfs, tmpfs scratch at /tmp
- CPU + memory cgroup limits
- Network: friday-execution-net (bridge, Frappe API host only)
- Scoped credentials via env var

Phase 1: cold-spawn per execution.
Phase 1.5: warm container pool.
