"""
Migration helper — seeded defaults for the Friday LLM stack.

Called on every `bench --site <site> migrate` via the `after_migrate` hook
in `frappe/hooks.py`.

What it does
============

Ensures the `Agent Settings` singleton row exists (one row named
"Agent Settings"). This row holds global defaults — currently only the
`default_provider` link. If it already exists, the function is a no-op.

Safe to call repeatedly. Frappe will raise if a second row is created
(because the DocType has `autoincrement=False`).

Why this is a hook target
=========================

Frappe's `after_migrate` hook fires after every `bench migrate` — including
on a fresh site where no Agent Settings row has ever existed. This ensures
the singleton is always present when the site boots, without requiring
operators to manually create it.
