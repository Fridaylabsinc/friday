The prompt builder — assembling the full LLM prompt from Frappe state.

PLAIN ENGLISH
=============

Before the LLM can answer, it needs a properly formatted prompt. This
module builds that prompt from three ingredients:

  1. **System prompt** — static instructions from `Agent Profile.system_prompt`.
     Set by the operator in Desk; the LLM treats it as foundational context.
  2. **Conversation history** — prior turns in this session (Chat Message
     rows, oldest first). The LLM uses this for continuity.
  3. **Tool definitions** — what tools the agent is permitted to use, from
     the Slice 3 skill loader. Passed as the `tools` parameter so the LLM
     can decide to call a tool or respond in text.

The output of `build()` is a dict ready to hand to `provider.chat()`:

    {
        "messages": [...],   # list of {role, content}
        "tools": [...],       # OpenAI-format tool defs or None
        "model": "MiniMax-Standard",
    }

IMPORTANT: `build()` is a pure function. It reads from the database
(history) but produces the same output for the same inputs. This makes
it easy to test: given fixed database state, the output is deterministic.

CONVERSATION HISTORY
====================

We load the last `max_history_turns` Chat Message rows for the session:

  - Inbound (user → agent): role="user"
  - Outbound (agent → user): role="assistant"

We stop after `max_history_turns` even if more history exists.
This is a conservative truncation — the LLM still has full context for
recent conversation, and long-history handling is deferred to
trajectory compression (future slice).

SYSTEM PROMPT ASSEMBLY
=====================

`Agent Profile.system_prompt` is stored as operator-authored text.
We wrap it with minimal framing:

    You are a Friday AI Agent. ...
    <operator's system_prompt>
    (no extra framing beyond this)

The operator controls the content; we don't inject Friday-internal
details into it. This keeps the system prompt human-readable and
editable without understanding the framework internals.

WHAT THIS MODULE DOES NOT DO
=============================

- Does not call the LLM. The caller does that.
- Does not write Chat Message rows. The caller does that.
- Does not decide which skills are permitted. That comes already-filtered
  from `load_for_profile()` in the runner.
