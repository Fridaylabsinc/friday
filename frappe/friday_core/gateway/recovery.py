"""
The orphan recovery sweeper — Q5 half-step.

PLAIN ENGLISH
=============

In async dispatch mode, the gateway runs in an RQ worker (separate
process). The inbound Chat Message row is committed before the worker
picks up the job. If the worker dies mid-turn (OOM, timeout, crash),
the inbound row sits there with `processed=0` and no outbound was ever
written. The user (or webhook caller) is left hanging.

This module runs every minute as a Frappe scheduled task. It finds those
orphaned rows and re-runs them, up to 3 retries. After 3 failures it
writes a system-error outbound and gives up.

SYNC MODE DOES NOT NEED THIS
============================

When dispatch_mode is "sync" (CLI path), the gateway runs INSIDE the
inbound row's transaction. If anything raises, the inbound row never
persists — Frappe rolls it back. There's nothing to recover. This
sweeper is correct dead code on a CLI-only deployment; it activates
the moment the first async surface (Telegram, Slack, Raven webhook)
lands.

TUNING (locked per §4 Q5)
==========================

- Stale-threshold: 5 minutes. An inbound row older than this with
  processed=0 is considered orphaned. Long enough that legitimately-
  slow agent runs don't trigger false positives; short enough that
  users don't wait forever.
- Max retries: 3. Standard.
- On final give-up: write a system-error outbound, mark
  processed=1, populate failure_reason. The user sees the error
  message; audit trail records why.

===============

- `docs/design/47-gateway-design-decisions.md` §4 Q5 — the contract.
- `feedback-single-tenant-not-saas` — sizing rationale.
