"""
The audit-log writer for permission decisions.

PLAIN ENGLISH
=============

Every time the permission engine answers the question "can this agent
run this skill?" — for allow OR deny — we write one row to the
**Permission Decision Log** DocType. That row is then *submitted*,
which in Frappe means it becomes immutable: nobody can edit or delete
it later, not even an admin.

Why so paranoid? Because the decision log is what auditors,
regulators, and incident-responders read after the fact to answer
questions like:

  - "Did the Procurement Agent have permission to create that purchase
    order on March 12th?"
  - "Why was the Sales Agent denied access to Customer records last
    week?"
  - "Show me every time Agent X was allowed to do something risky."

If those rows could be quietly edited, the log is worthless. So:
write once, never change.

WHAT WE STORE PER DECISION
==========================

  - `agent_profile` — which agent asked (link to Agent Profile).
  - `skill`         — which skill they wanted (link to Skill).
  - `decision`      — "allowed" or "denied".
  - `reason`        — the human-readable string from the Decision
                      ("Allowed" / "Profile lacks 'write' on …").
  - `matrix_snapshot` — JSON dump of the PermissionMatrix that was used.
                        This makes the decision *reproducible later*
                        even after the agent's roles change or skills
                        get edited.
  - `decided_at`    — timestamp of the decision.

The matrix snapshot is the important one. Without it, "the agent was
denied at 2pm" tells you nothing if at 3pm someone changed the
permissions. With it, you can reconstruct exactly what the world
looked like to the engine at decision time.

WHY `ignore_permissions=True` WHEN INSERTING
============================================

By default, Frappe checks the *current user's* permissions before
inserting a record. But this code path runs as part of the *system*
recording its own audit — there isn't really a "user" with a role
that says "may create Permission Decision Log rows". Skipping the
permission check is correct here: we are the audit machinery, not a
user-driven write.

If we left the permission check on, the log writes would fail for
most callers, which would either crash the agent or — worse — silently
swallow the failure and let actions proceed without a log row. Neither
is acceptable for an audit log.

WHY THIS IS ITS OWN FILE
========================

Could've been one more function on `matrix.py`. We split it because
audit-log writing is a *different concern* than permission deciding:
different DocType, different I/O pattern, different reasons to change
(e.g. one day we might add a webhook on each decision; that change
should not touch the decision logic). Single Responsibility, applied.
