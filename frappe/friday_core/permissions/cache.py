"""
The Redis cache for permission matrices — making the check fast.

PLAIN ENGLISH
=============

`matrix.py` answers the question "what can this agent do?" by reading
several DocTypes from PostgreSQL and joining them. That's accurate but
slow — too slow to run before *every* skill invocation when an agent
might do hundreds per minute.

So we cache the result. The flow is:

  1. `build_matrix(profile)` checks "do I have this in Redis?"
  2. If yes (a "cache hit"), we return that and skip the database.
  3. If no (a "cache miss"), we do the slow build, then store the
     result in Redis with a 60-second timer.

After 60 seconds the entry expires and the next call rebuilds. We also
expire it earlier when things change — see "Invalidation" below.

WHY REDIS
=========

Frappe already ships with Redis for its own caching. `frappe.cache()`
returns a wrapper around the same Redis instance, so we get a tested,
shared cache without standing up new infrastructure. Same Redis, just
keys prefixed `friday:perm_matrix:` so we don't collide with anything.

KEY SHAPE
=========

    friday:perm_matrix:{profile_name}

One key per Agent Profile. So invalidating a single profile is a single
DELETE, and invalidating everything is one `DELETE WHERE key LIKE
'friday:perm_matrix:*'` (Frappe's `delete_keys` does that pattern match
for us).

INVALIDATION
============

The cache TTL is 60 seconds, but we also flush eagerly when something
that could change permissions actually changes. Two hooks wired in
`frappe/hooks.py`:

  - **Agent Profile.on_update → `invalidate_for_profile`** — when a
    specific profile is edited (role added, status changed, etc.), drop
    only that profile's cached matrix. Other profiles keep their hot
    cache entries.

  - **Role.on_update → `invalidate_all`** — when a Role itself changes
    (e.g. an admin uses Role Permissions Manager to give the role a
    new DocType permission), we don't know which profiles are
    affected, so we drop every `friday:perm_matrix:*` key. Heavier,
    but Role updates are rare in normal operation.

WHY TWO INVALIDATION FUNCTIONS, NOT ONE
=======================================

Frappe's `doc_events` hooks call your function with the doc that
changed plus the method name. The Agent Profile hook gets an Agent
Profile doc (so we know which profile to flush). The Role hook gets a
Role doc (which doesn't tell us which profiles have that role without
another query). The simplest correct answer for Role updates is "flush
everything" — so we have two functions with different scopes.

WHAT THIS MODULE DOES NOT DO
============================

- Doesn't write to or read from PostgreSQL. Pure Redis.
- Doesn't make permission decisions. That's `matrix.evaluate` /
  `matrix.check`.
- Doesn't write audit logs. That's `decisions.record`.

Single responsibility on purpose: makes testing easy and means a Redis
outage degrades to "permission checks get slower" rather than "wrong
decisions get cached".
