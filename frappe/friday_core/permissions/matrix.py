The permission engine — does this agent have permission to use this skill?

PLAIN ENGLISH
=============

Friday lets AI agents do real work inside a business (create records,
send emails, run queries). Before any of that work runs, we have to
answer one question:

    "Is this agent allowed to call this skill?"

This file answers that question. Three steps:

  1. **Look up the agent** — read the Agent Profile DocType, see which
     Frappe roles it has (a "role" is just a named bundle of permissions,
     like 'Sales User' or 'Accountant'; same idea as a job role).
  2. **Add up what those roles can do** — every role has rows in
     Frappe's DocPerm table that say "this role can read/write/create/
     delete this DocType". We collect all of those into one big map
     called the "permission matrix": `{doctype: {operations the agent
     can do on it}}`.
  3. **Compare with what the skill needs** — every Skill DocType lists
     `required_doctypes` (rows like "I need to *read* the Note doctype"
     and "I need to *create* the ToDo doctype"). If every required
     (doctype, operation) is in the matrix → ALLOW. If even one is
     missing → DENY, with a reason that names what's missing.

We also reject in two more cases, before looking at the matrix at all:

  - The Agent Profile is not "Active" (e.g. Suspended, Retired). A
    paused worker doesn't get to act, even if their permissions would
    have allowed it.
  - The Skill is not "Active" (Draft, Experimental, Retired, Archived).
    Skills that haven't been promoted to Active are not safe to run in
    production, regardless of who's asking.

PUBLIC FUNCTIONS (what other code calls)
========================================

- `build_matrix(profile_name)` — get the permission matrix for an agent,
  using the Redis cache when warm. Use this if you want to inspect what
  an agent can do without actually checking a specific skill.

- `evaluate(matrix, skill_name)` — pure decision logic. Given a matrix
  and a skill, return `Decision(allowed, reason)`. No side effects, no
  database writes. This is what tests aim at for branch coverage.

- `check(profile_name, skill_name)` — the **gateway entry point**. The
  agent execution loop calls this just before queueing any skill work.
  It builds the matrix (cache-aware), evaluates it, and writes an
  immutable Permission Decision Log row with the outcome. Returns the
  same `Decision` object `evaluate` does.

NON-OBVIOUS DECISIONS
=====================

- **Why two functions, `check` and `evaluate`?** Because the design doc
  says the deliverable command is `check(profile, skill)` (two strings),
  but also lists the internal signature as `check(matrix, skill)`. Those
  are different functions doing different jobs, so we gave them
  different names: `evaluate` is the pure version (no I/O — easy to test),
  `check` is the orchestrator (builds matrix + logs decision — the
  one real callers use).

- **Why is the matrix cached at all?** The check has to run *before* every
  skill invocation. If even one agent makes 100 calls per minute and each
  build_matrix hits the database 3 times, that's 300 round-trips/min of
  pure permission overhead. Caching the matrix for 60 seconds drops that
  to ~1 round-trip/min/agent.

- **Why 60 seconds and not longer?** Two reasons. (1) Permission changes
  must take effect quickly — a manager suspends an agent at 12:00:00,
  they should not be running at 12:01:00. (2) We also invalidate on
  Agent Profile and Role updates, so 60s is the worst case, not the
  norm.

- **Why is `ignore_permissions=True` used when writing the log?** Because
  the system is recording its own audit trail. This is not a user-driven
  write that should be permission-checked — denying the log write would
  hide the very thing it's trying to record.

REFERENCED DESIGN DOCS
======================
- `docs/design/04-security-model.md` §Layer 2 (Gateway pre-check) — the
  intent, why this matters.
- `docs/design/10-agent-execution-guide.md` §Slice 2 — the spec, what
  functions and tests must exist.
- `docs/design/05-module-design.md` — the DocType fields this code reads.
