"""
Bench command registration for the Friday CLI surfaces.

PLAIN ENGLISH
=============

Frappe's bench CLI is built with click. Each Frappe app contributes
subcommands by exposing a `commands` list at the app-root module's
`commands` submodule — Frappe's `utils/bench_helper.py:get_app_commands`
does `importlib.import_module(f"{app}.commands")` and reads the
`commands` attribute. So bench's standard pickup point for the Frappe
app is `frappe/commands/__init__.py`, not `hooks.py`.

Because friday_core lives inside the Frappe fork (we chose
"Option C — keep everything inside frappe/friday_core/" — see project
memory), our friday command group is appended to Frappe's
`get_commands()` aggregator at `frappe/commands/__init__.py`. The
edit there imports `commands` from this module and adds it to the
existing tuple.

We expose a single click Group named `friday` so all Friday
subcommands are namespaced — `bench --site X friday chat`,
`bench --site X friday <future-subcommand>`. No collisions with stock
Frappe / ERPNext command names.

WHY click AND NOT argparse / typer
==================================

Because Frappe ships click and its own command loader expects click
groups. Bringing in another argument parser would mean either
re-implementing the bench glue or wrapping click anyway — neither buys
anything. See `frappe/commands/__init__.py` for the loader.
