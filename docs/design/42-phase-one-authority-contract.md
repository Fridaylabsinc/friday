# 42 — Phase One Authority Contract

> **Status:** Highest authority for v0.1 scope. Where any other document describes "Phase 1" and conflicts with this contract, this document wins. No exceptions.

---

## 1. Authority Hierarchy

When implementation decisions conflict, resolve in this order:

1. `39-friday-framework-strategy.md` — framework identity and fork discipline
2. `41-porting-strategy-hermes-erpnext-raven.md` — Hermes / ERPNext / Raven translation
3. **This document** — v0.1 scope authority
4. `06-phase-one-scope.md`, `10-agent-execution-guide.md`, `11-agent-validation-checklist.md`
5. Other design documents — roadmap context only

---

## 2. Phase 1 Goal

Phase 1 proves the governed framework loop and the Friday product feel.

**The required proof:**

> A user can create or send work into Friday. Friday resolves an Agent Profile, loads governed Skills from DocTypes, checks permissions, executes one approved skill in a sandboxed path, records immutable logs, updates an Agent Task through a configurable workflow, and shows the result in the Framework Console.

That is the foundation. Everything else is breadth, not depth.

ERPNext Purchase Order automation remains inside the Phase 1 program as the flagship dogfood track — but it starts **after** the governed framework loop is proven. The mistake to avoid: making PO automation the first engineering slice, before the framework has identity, permissions, workflow, and audit.

## 3. In Scope for v0.1

### Framework Shell
- Friday repository forked from Frappe v16 stable
- Full bench ecosystem retained and documented
- `friday` command group (or bench plugin) for agent-specific operations
- Framework Console workspace as the default operator surface
- Agent-native primitives in framework core: actor context, trace propagation, audit hooks, agent-scoped auth
- Core divergences documented in `docs/core-divergences.md`

### Agent Kernel DocTypes
- `Agent Profile`
- `Agent Role Profile` (if Frappe Role Profile is insufficient after evaluation)
- `Skill`
- `Execution Log` (submittable — immutable audit trail)
- `Permission Decision Log` (submittable — immutable audit trail)
- `Workflow Request` schema
- `Agent Project`
- `Agent Task`
- `Agent Task Event` (or equivalent event/timeline record)

### Workflow and Board
- Configurable Agent Task workflow (first template may be simple)
- Kanban renders workflow states as columns
- States marked dispatchable; dispatcher claims only dispatchable tasks
- Explicit outcomes: blocked / completed / failed

### Execution
- One end-to-end skill (e.g. `create_note`)
- Permission check before execution
- Sandboxed execution path (Docker, minimum bar per §5)
- Structured result capture
- Immutable Execution Log
- Immutable Permission Decision Log

### Framework Console (minimum)
- Active tasks
- Active / suspended agents
- Recent executions
- Permission denials
- Task state changes
- Pause / suspend path for agents

### Raven
Raven is **optional for v0.1** unless the feasibility spike confirms it is low-risk to include.

If included, Raven is a War Room bridge only:
- Conversation surface
- Task and execution event posting
- Message Actions routed through Friday permission checks

Raven does not own task truth, execution truth, permissions, or audit.

---

## 4. Out of Scope for v0.1

These are not "nice to have later" — they are explicit exclusions from v0.1 that will not be considered even if a document calls them Phase 1.

- Autopilot mode
- Autonomous profile activation
- Autonomous skill activation or learning loop that changes active skills
- Semantic memory / pgvector queries (installed but not used)
- Wiki / knowledge graph
- Cross-site agent communication
- Multi-platform adapters beyond CLI or Raven (if Raven is included)
- Deep Raven fork
- Full ERPNext domain-agent suite (PO flagship comes after v0.1)
- Production-grade multi-host scaling

---

## 5. Sandbox Minimum Bar

Phase 1 must not be unsafe. The minimum bar is not the production sandbox.

**Required for v0.1:**
- Non-root container user
- CPU and memory resource limits
- Timeout handling
- OOM handling
- No host filesystem mounts
- No Docker socket mount
- Scoped credentials (short-lived API token, not long-lived)
- Structured stdout/stderr/result capture
- Cleanup path (no orphaned containers)
- Execution Log row for every attempt

**Deferred to Phase 1.5:**
- Warm container pool
- Egress proxy and allowlist enforcement
- Read-only rootfs on all runtimes
- Full automated security attack suite
- Multi-host orchestration
- gVisor / Firecracker backend

---

## 6. ERPNext PO Flagship Track

The ERPNext Purchase Order workflow is the first named business use case of Phase 1. It is not v0.1. It begins after v0.1 proves the framework loop.

**Gate: v0.1 must be green before PO track starts.**

v0.1 gates for PO track readiness:
1. Agent Project / Agent Task orchestration works
2. Agent Profile and Skill governance works
3. Permission and execution logs are reliable
4. Dispatcher handles configurable workflows
5. Framework Console lets a human understand and stop the system

**Minimum PO track scope (after v0.1):**
- Procurement Agent profile
- Inventory read-only support or alerts
- Coordinator Agent basic oversight
- Operations Policy DocType (approval thresholds)
- PO draft / supplier follow-up / GRN matching / variance flagging
- Human approval for all high-risk and financially binding actions
- Zero unsafe actions
- Full audit traceability

---

## 7. Completion Gate

v0.1 is complete when all of the following are true:

- [ ] A Friday site installs and migrates cleanly from a fresh bench
- [ ] Framework Console exists and is the default workspace
- [ ] Agent Profile, Skill, Agent Project, Agent Task, Execution Log, and Permission Decision Log DocTypes exist
- [ ] A user can create or submit a task
- [ ] Dispatcher claims a dispatchable task exactly once (concurrency-safe)
- [ ] Agent executes one approved skill through the governed path
- [ ] Denied skill calls are logged to Permission Decision Log and rejected without execution
- [ ] Task state changes are visible in list / report / Kanban views
- [ ] Execution and permission logs are sufficient to reconstruct exactly what happened
- [ ] Tests cover permission checks, dispatcher claim safety, and the first end-to-end skill

After this gate is green, the PO flagship track begins.

---

## 8. Summary

Phase 1 is not "build all of Friday."

Phase 1 is:

> Build the smallest Friday that proves agents can operate inside a typed, permissioned, auditable Frappe-derived framework — running on Frappe v16 with agent-native primitives in core, with a Framework Console that lets a human understand and stop what the agents are doing.
