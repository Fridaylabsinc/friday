# Friday — Governed Agentic Framework on Frappe v16

> **Made in India. Built for Indian businesses. Open source under GPL v3.**

Friday is a hard fork of Frappe v16 stable that makes AI agents a first-class primitive of the framework — not an app you install on top, not a bolt-on layer, but a native part of the framework itself. Agent identity, skill dispatch, permission gating, sandboxed execution, and immutable audit logs are built into core.

The mission: every Indian SMB owner gets a governed, auditable back-office agent team that runs on their own infrastructure, without vendor lock-in, without predatory licensing, and without compromising on security.

## What Friday Is

**Friday is the fork.** The Friday repository starts from Frappe v16 stable and builds agent-native primitives directly into framework core. The full bench ecosystem is retained. The product surface is the Framework Console. The agent runtime is the engine.

**Agents are first-class, not bolted on.** Agent Profile, Skill, Execution Log, Permission Decision Log, and Sandbox Execution are framework primitives — they exist in every Friday site by default, the same way User and Role exist in every Frappe site.

**Permission first, always.** Every skill invocation passes through Frappe's role-based permission engine before anything executes. No exceptions. Permission decisions are logged immutably.

**Kanban is a view, not the workflow.** Business workflows are defined through Frappe Workflow. The Kanban board renders whatever states are configured. Agents operate inside governed workflows; they do not invent them.

## What Friday Is Not

- Not a fork of Hermes or OpenClaw (Friday re-implements their ideas on a governed enterprise substrate)
- Not a thin "AI app installed on Frappe" with no framework identity
- Not tied to a single LLM provider (provider-agnostic from day one)
- Not an ERPNext dependency (specific DocTypes are ported into Friday, not inherited)
- Not a SaaS-only product (self-hosted first; FridayLabs hosted platform is a separate future project)

---

## Architecture in One Paragraph

Friday runs on a single-site bench installation (one bench = one agent ecosystem). Gunicorn serves the Framework Console (HTTP + WebSocket). A dedicated Agent Core Worker runs the Hermes-derived agent execution loop continuously alongside it — these are two separate processes with two separate lifecycles. Agents execute skills inside Docker sandboxes with scoped credentials and network restrictions. All state — agent profiles, skills, tasks, execution logs, permission decisions — lives in PostgreSQL. Redis handles caching, job queuing, and real-time pub/sub. Raven (installed as a Friday app) provides the War Room communication layer per project.

## Made in India 🇮🇳

Friday is built in India, for Indian growing businesses, by an Indian founder. We stand on the shoulders of Frappe (Mumbai), Raven (The Commit Company), and the global Hermes / OpenClaw communities — and add the governance, accessibility, and economic alignment that the next chapter requires.

**Open source. No proprietary trap doors. No per-seat licensing. No vendor lock-in. Ever.**
