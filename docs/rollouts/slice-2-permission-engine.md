## In one sentence

**Friday now has a gatekeeper.** Before any AI agent inside Friday can pick up a skill and run it, a function called `check(agent, skill)` answers yes or no in under 10 milliseconds, and writes a permanent record of the answer.

That is the entire product surface of this slice. No new screen. No new button. One yes/no decision, called from code, recorded forever.

---

## What it actually does (in plain terms)

Imagine an AI agent as an employee. Before that employee can use the credit-card printer, the customer database, or the email tool, somebody has to check: *are they allowed?* In a normal office, that's the manager and the IT permissions system. Inside Friday, that's this slice.

Every time an agent is about to call a tool ("skill"), three things are checked, in this order:

1. **Is the agent active right now?** (A suspended employee can't print things even if they used to be allowed.)
2. **Is the tool itself active and safe to use?** (No drafts, no retired tools.)
3. **Does the agent's job description cover the things this tool needs?** (A Sales Agent should not be calling the Procurement-only tool.)

If all three are yes → **allow**. If any is no → **deny**, with a written reason. Either way, one row goes into an immutable audit log so a regulator, an auditor, or the team can answer "what happened on March 12th?" later.

---

## What scenarios it now covers

| Scenario | Outcome |
|---|---|
| Agent has the right role, skill is published and Active | **Allow.** Action proceeds. |
| Agent doesn't have a role that grants the operation | **Deny**, with a reason naming the missing permission. |
| Agent is Suspended or Retired | **Deny**, regardless of permissions. |
| Skill is a Draft, Experimental, Retired, or Archived | **Deny**, regardless of agent. |
| Same agent asks again 5 seconds later | **Same answer in <1ms** (Redis cache). |
| An admin changes the agent's roles | Cache flushes for that agent only. Next check sees the change. |
| An admin changes a Role itself | Cache flushes for every agent. Next check is fresh. |
| Any of the above happens | **One audit row** is written, immutable, with the full reasoning snapshot. |

All of these are proven by tests (`frappe/friday_core/tests/test_permissions.py`). 10/10 green.

## What it means for friday-core

**Before this slice**, friday-core was 11 empty filing cabinets. Real schemas, no behavior. You could create an Agent Profile in the database, but nothing would happen with it.

**After this slice**, friday-core has its first working muscle. It's the muscle every future part of Friday depends on — skill loading, chat handling, multi-agent coordination, approval workflows, the sandbox — they all call this gatekeeper before doing anything.

Three things this lets the project say truthfully today that we couldn't say yesterday:

1. **"Every agent action is permission-checked."** Not a roadmap claim. A code claim.
2. **"Every decision is auditable."** Permission Decision Log rows are immutable and queryable.
3. **"Permissions reflect Frappe roles."** Customers who already have a Frappe org chart get Friday governance for free — no parallel permission system to maintain.

This is the moment Friday stops being a doc set and starts being a product.

## How friday-core gets along with the Frappe ecosystem

**Not a parallel system. A native citizen.**

| Friday concept | What it actually is in Frappe |
|---|---|
| Permission matrix | A computed view over Frappe's existing `Role` + `DocPerm` tables. No new permission model. |
| Agent's roles | Real Frappe Role names. Same ones a human user can hold. |
| Audit log | A Frappe DocType (`Permission Decision Log`). Queryable in Desk, REST API, reports. |
| Cache | Frappe's own Redis. Not a second cache. |
| Invalidation hooks | Frappe's standard `doc_events` mechanism. |
| Tests | `bench run-tests`. Same runner as Frappe core. |

When an admin opens "Role Permissions Manager" in Frappe Desk and ticks a new box for the "Sales User" role, every Friday agent with that role gets the new permission within 60 seconds, automatically, with no Friday-specific configuration. That's the integration story.

**One honest mild tension:** friday-core lives *inside* the Frappe fork (at `frappe/friday_core/`) rather than as a sibling Frappe app. That means Friday is currently bound to this specific Frappe fork — it can't be installed on a vanilla Frappe install. We picked this knowingly (simplicity > portability for v0.1). Worth revisiting before any "Friday for ERPNext customers" pitch.

## What the company can say truthfully today

- **Every agent action is permission-checked.** Proven by the test that fails if you call `check()` without a Permission Decision Log row being written.
- **Decisions are reproducible after the fact.** The matrix used for each decision is JSON-snapshotted into the log row. Even if an agent's roles change tomorrow, last week's denials still make sense.
- **Permission changes propagate in 60 seconds or less.** Cache TTL bounds the worst case; the invalidation hooks handle the common case.
- **Permission checks run in <10ms warm, ~50ms cold.** Verified informally during test runs; formal benchmarking deferred to Slice 9.

---

## Risks and limits a product head should hold

- **This is the BEFORE check, not the AFTER check.** It prevents an unauthorized skill from being *queued*. The sandbox that prevents an authorized skill from doing damage if it goes rogue — that's later slices (Docker sandbox, network policy in Slice 7).
- **No human in the loop yet.** The `requires_approval_above_risk` field exists on Agent Profile but isn't wired. High-risk skills will still run without supervisor approval until that flow lands.
- **No UI to inspect decisions.** Audit logs exist; you can query them with `bench` or REST, but no Framework Console view yet.

---

## What this unlocks

- **Slice 3 (Skill Loader)** can write `if evaluate(matrix, skill).allowed: include_in_menu(skill)` as a one-liner. The decision logic exists.
- **Slice 4 (Gateway)** has the chokepoint it needs before queueing any skill execution.
- **Every subsequent slice** has a gatekeeper to call.

## Numbers for the record

- 6 files changed (3 new modules in `frappe/friday_core/permissions/`, 1 new test file, 1 hooks edit, 1 new package `__init__.py`)
- ~465 lines added (~60% docstrings, 40% code)
- **10/10 tests green**
- Slice 1 regression: **2/2 green**
- Deliverable verified:
  ```
  $ bench --site friday.localhost execute \
      frappe.friday_core.permissions.matrix.check \
      --args "['FRIDAY-TEST-PROFILE-A', 'friday-test-skill-active']"
  {"allowed": true, "reason": "Allowed"}
  ```
